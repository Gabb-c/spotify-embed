# spotify-embed

A plug-n-play Spotify Embed Component. An easy way to use Spotify Embeds with just the resource URL/URI.
You can create Embeds for **albums, tracks, artists, or playlists**.

When a logged-in Spotify user clicks the button, the music starts playing in the Spotify player.
For users who are not logged in on their Spotify account, the Spotify Embed plays a 30-second long audio preview,
and then the users are prompted to either login or to sign up.
